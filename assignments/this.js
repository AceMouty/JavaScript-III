/* The for principles of "this";
* in your own words. explain the four principle for the "this" keyword below.
*
* 1. Window binding, by default the 'this' keyword will bind it's self to the window object when refrenced in the context of console.log(this) and nothing else
* 2. Implicit Binding - Implicit binding happens when you are in an object litteral and run a method using 'this'. In this context we are refrencing the object we are in.
* 3. new Binding - Whenever a constructor function is used, 'this' refers to the specific instance of the object that is created and returned by the constructor function.
* 4. Explicit binding - This overrides which object 'this' is pointing to.
*
* write out a code example of each explanation above
